      <p class="last-updated">Last updated: {{lastUpdated}}</p>

      <p>
        Band Central ("we", "our", or "us") operates the Band Central website and mobile application.
        This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our service.
      </p>

      <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

      <p><strong>Account Information</strong></p>
      <p>
        When you create an account, we collect your email address and display name through Firebase Authentication.
        You may also sign in using third-party providers (such as Google), in which case we receive your name,
        email address, and profile photo URL from that provider.
      </p>

      <p><strong>User Content</strong></p>
      <p>
        We store content you create within the app, including songs, lyrics, setlists, tags, and related metadata.
        This content is stored in Google Cloud Firestore and is associated with your account.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Usage and Analytics Data</strong></p>
      <p>
        We use Google Analytics and Firebase Crashlytics to collect anonymized usage data and crash reports.
        This may include device type, operating system, app interactions, and performance data.
        This information helps us improve the app experience and fix issues.
      </p>
